# React Native Starter project

Does this sound familiar. You have a great idea that you want to test out. After a while of programming, you realise how much time is going to take before you have the basics set up. You lose your interest and decide to continue working on the project some other time.

Well if you are like me, this has happened to you more than once. I decided enough is enough it’s time to deal with this problem once and for all. Let’s create a starter project which has everything you need to start developing your idea right away. So what do we need? We need some sort of navigation and state management. Let's also add .svg picture support, Typescript and encrypted storage for securing login tokens. 


You are encouraged to fork this solution and expand it to your liking. 

### NOTE! This is a work in progress. More functionality will be added.
