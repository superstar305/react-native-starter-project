# React Native Starter project

Does this sound familiar. You have a great idea. You decide to start a new project. After a while of programming, you realise how much time is going to take before you have the basics set up. You lose your interest and decide to continue working on the project some other time.

Well if you are like me, this has happened to you more than once. I decided enough is enough it’s time to deal with this problem once and for all. Let’s create a starter project which has everything you need to start developing your idea right away. So what do we need? We definitely need some sort of navigation and state management. In every project, I also use .svg pictures, Typescript and encrypted storage for securing login tokens. 

### NOTE! This is a work in progress. More functionality will be added.
